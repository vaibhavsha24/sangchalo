# sangchalo

Sang Chalo is a Car pool Android app used by people to pool the cars and share the price which is both cost effective and environment friendly.
I have used Google Maps, Firebase, Shared Preferences, Firebase Auth, Firebase Realtime Database and much more.
For all the Map Work Google libraries are used for fetching location making navigation and much more related to Map Work.
